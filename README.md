# MaKore-BestWayToCommunicate
This repository is an overview about the "MaKore" project - MaKore is a communication app we build during "Advanced Programming 2" course. <br>
During the course (and for this project) I learned how to work with - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, ASP.net and C#, SignalR, MVC design pattern, MySQL database, JSON Web Token (JWT), Service pattern, Java, Android, Activities and Layouts, Firebase and Room. <br>
MaKore has a server, a web client and an Android client. <br>
For more information about each part, please see below the repositories.
